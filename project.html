            <p> Our two friends decided to buy an Uno game from a supermarket. They found the game and added it to their shopping cart. However, when they reached the checkout counter, they found long lines of customers waiting to pay for their purchases. They joined the queue, but it took them a lot of time to reach the counter and complete the transaction.

            <p>Frustrated by the long wait, the friends thought of a solution. 
                They remembered hearing about a smart trolley system that could make shopping and checkout 
                faster and more efficient.
                 They decided to do some research and found out that the supermarket they were 
                 in could implement a smart trolley system. Excited by this discovery, 
                 the friends found a smart trolley and thought about making an invention.
                  They were delighted to find that the trolley had features such as barcode scanning,
                   item tracking, and payment processing, which made shopping a breeze.</p>
